A stock split occurs when a company increases the number of shares outstanding by
issuing more shares to shareholders, while reducing the price of each share in proportion.
For example, if a company has a 2-for-1 stock split, a shareholder who previously owned

100 shares of the stock would now own 200 shares, but the total value of their investment
would remain the same.
A stock consolidation, also known as a reverse split, is the opposite of a stock split. In a
consolidation, the number of shares outstanding is reduced by retiring some of the shares
and increasing the price of each remaining share in proportion. For example, if a company
has a 1-for-2 consolidation, a shareholder who previously owned 100 shares of the stock
would now own 50 shares, but the total value of their investment would remain the same.
